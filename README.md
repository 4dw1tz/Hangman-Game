# Hangman-Game
This is the digital version of the classic word-guessing hangman game integrated with a GUI using both a combination of the turtle and Tkinter pre-installed frameworks of Python.
Incase you don't know how to play hangman, the computer will choose a random word and you will have to try to guess that word by guessing letters. You have 11 lives before your character is fully drawn and gets hung, and each time you guess a wrong letter, you lose a life. You will be presented with dashes corresponding to the number of letters in the word and as you guess correct letters, those letters will appear in the correct place(es).

To download the game, all you need is Python installed on your computer so you can view and even make edits to the files as you please.
The list of words in the "nounlist" text file is a Kaggle dataset created by @Manuel Leite.
MAKE SURE BOTH FILES ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER WHEN RUNNING THE GAME!

ENJOY!
